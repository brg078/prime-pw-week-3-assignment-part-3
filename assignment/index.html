      <ol>
        <li> How does JS know to assign the value 'i' to the array number in 'supplyChanges'?  It isn't explicitly commanded to associate together.</li>
        <li> Frankly I am stumped at the code on stretch goal 8.  I just googled how to do it but don't really understand it.</li>
      </ol>
